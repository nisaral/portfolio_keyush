HTML and CSS form the foundation of modern web design, allowing you to create visually appealing & functional web pages.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It is used to structure content and add elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It allows you to control layout and appearance by defining styles for elements such as fonts, colors, margins, borders, and more.

Tags are the building blocks of HTML, used to describe the structure and content of a webpage.

alt
Tags are denoted by angle brackets, with the opening tag starting with < and the closing tag starting with '</'.

The opening tag of a tag pair contains the name of the tag, such as p for a paragraph tag

The closing tag has the same name but with a forward slash before it, such as </p>.

A tag contains one or more children. A tag and its children are together referred to as an element.

Tags can contain attributes whose values are often used to modify the behavior of the tag

Different tags are used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and other elements.

html Tag
Every web page starts with the <html> tag (and ends with it's corresponding closing tag </html>)

alt
It's the outermost tag for every web page and must always be present.
It generally contains the tags <head> and <body> within it.
It has a lang attribute to indicate the language within the page.
You'll also often see a <!doctype> tag just above the HTML tag
